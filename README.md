Identify and remove the habits that have you habitually opening websites.

Create a list of URL's and they will have a delay before the websites displayed. The delay enables you to recognise you've opened a certain URL and gives you time to to acknowledge a typically unconscious decision. 
Once the tabs delay has expired you can continue browsing blacklisted websites without inuring more delays.
