Identify and remove the habits that have you habitually opening websites.

Create a list of URL's and they will have a delay before the websites displayed. The delay enables you to recognise you've opened a certain URL and gives you time to acknowledge what is typically an unconscious decision. 
Once the tabs delay has expired you can continue browsing blacklisted websites within that tab.
